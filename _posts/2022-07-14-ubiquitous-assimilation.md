_Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, slight exhale, swipe, swipe. _

For many of us our day to day lives revolve around the whims of corporate execs on the top floors of buildings. An addiction to these apps can actively prevent us from being happy, yet we still retain our habits. In my personal experience, social media has ruined many of my own relationships with people, and has forced me to live a secluded life with almost no contact. Now, I have since gotten out of this rut, and I do have friends, but the irony remains with me. The apps that promise connection to other people, have the adverse effect unless used in moderation. Moderation, however, is not at all what these companies (Youtube, Tiktok, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) have in mind. they always require more clicks. **AND SO**, unless moderation whether internally from the companies themselves, or externally from policy is exhibitied, the american people will slowly succumb to the disease that is social media.
